To-Do

General
- prepare demo for Shalin
- Look into integration with SciView
- Reach out to Kyle about python integration
- make textboard work the way described in Steve's lab by Fabio. Off until you request them, then their location in space is calculated by your position/view in order to be unobscured and for the text not to be mirrored

Functionality
- add a default file path (rough fix, might want to make more inteligent/useful)
- break apart loadDataset() function
- Rethink colormap calling. 

Issues
- no color for most cell types
	- can be fixed by removing two statements in instancing - debug
- Not issue, but nan cells appear as ######## in excel
- Find a better way record the number of genes in the dataset (currently a global variable and assignment on line 312)
	- currently done with a small if statement - there may be a more efficient way to do this
- Will break with no default dataset. Find a better way to go to default if no datasets are found
- increasing and decreasing size of data: when going from increasing to decreasing, points lag input by one press. Textboards change size with input, points, grow/shrink for one more press before shrinking/growing.

Change-log

Fix notes
- Changed GMB dataset to comma-separated
- Both files now start with index, followed by cell name, n gene expression columns, three coordinate columns, and a one dataset column
- Tabula has 7 gene columsn, GMB has 10 columns
- added new colormap that better encodes gene expression (dark for more expression, down to almost white for no expression)
- commenting 
- commented part of color instancing fixed lack of gradient in color map - unclear what the other line was for - binary color encoding
- Rewriting of csvReader function to be dynamic and allow for datasets with a variable number of genes

14.12.20
- added a generateCylinder function to prevent reused code. Catches invalid dimensions and is not case sensitive.

15.12.20
- gene expression normalization now in a function and called in loadDataset()
- commenting

16.12.20
to-do: 
- update keybindings to new format
- color map out of loadDataset()
- "on a related note regarding OpenVR -- this now logs all input events when debug logging is activated, which can be done by setting the system property scenery.LogLevel.OpenVRHMD=debug
- make sure you initialise OpenVRHMD in the init() method, and not before"
- "check out VRControllerExample for the new key binding goodness"
- push with maven dependency on newest Scenery version
- Check if Vivie now takes inputs

changelog:
- placed OpenVRHMD into init()
- changed keybindings to directly reference controller key instead of keyboard key map
- changed scenery version reference in pom
